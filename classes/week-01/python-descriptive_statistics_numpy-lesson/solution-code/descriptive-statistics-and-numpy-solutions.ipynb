    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main fields of statistics: **descriptive** and **inferential**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use inferential statistics to make judgments about the world based on samples of data. For example, how dependable is an observed difference between groups? When we start covering modeling and hypothesis testing, our focus will shift to inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we're going to focus on descriptive statistics: describing, summarizing, and understanding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll focus on univariate statistics — that is, statistics or summaries that are calculated with **one variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables have what is called a **distribution**. The distribution is the set of all possible values that a variable can take on, as well as how frequently it takes on each of these values. (One popular way to visualize the distribution of a variable is by using a histogram or bar chart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider some quantitative variable — perhaps the hours of Netflix watched in a given month or the height of all of the people in your class. If you had access to this data, what are some questions you might have about that variable and its distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the center?\n",
    "- What is the spread?\n",
    "- What is the shape?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of this lesson covers the **measures of central tendency**. Measures of central tendency provide descriptive information about the single numerical value that is considered to be the \"most typical\" of the values of a quantitative variable.\n",
    "You're probably already familiar with some measures of central tendency: The **mean, median,** and **mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also discuss **skewness**, which is the lack of symmetry in a distribution of data that affects the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll take a look at **measures of dispersion** or variability in our data, namely the **range, variance**, and **standard deviation**.\n"
