    "In the previous lesson, we've learnt the basics of building a Flask application. Now lets assume you have finished building your new, awesome, world changing application. You don’t want to have to tell everyone, “Go check out my awesome new tool @ www.example.com:5000” that would be pretty lame. Not to mention to other drawbacks of using a development environment in production. Here I am going to show how we can use an Apache module called WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), to point Apache to your Flask application. We'll do all of this on a public-facing EC2 instance.\n",
