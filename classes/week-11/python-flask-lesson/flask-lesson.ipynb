    "Flask is called a _microframework_ because it is minimalistic and does not impose an application structure on you. Flask allows you to \"plug in\" libraries of your choice to add additional functionality. \"Heavier\" frameworks such as Django typically come with their own libraries (e.g. for database access). This is often convenient, but it takes more time to learn and is not as flexible.\n",
