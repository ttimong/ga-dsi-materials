# Data Pipeline Lab

In this lab you will create a basic pipeline around a model to predict survival on the Titanic. 

## Deliverables

Code that does the following:

1. Reproducibly transforms your incoming _test_ data in the same fashion as your _training_ set
2. Pipes it into your model
3. Stores your predictions and ID numbers to file

## How to start
